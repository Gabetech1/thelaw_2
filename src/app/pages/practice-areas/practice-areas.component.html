									Business Law
								</h2>
								<p>Corporate law involves the formation, dissolution, and all other legal aspects of the administration
									of corporations. Typical duties of corporate lawyers include mergers, acquisitions, internal
									reorganization, or disputes between corporations and individuals concerning liability, patents, and
									compliance with state and federal law, as well as international accords. A legal professional whose
									sole client is a corporation is generally known as in-house counsel</p>

									Tax Law
								</h2>
								<p>Tax law is a dynamic field that deals with domestic and international transactions. Because of the
									frequent modifications to local, state, and federal codes and the complexity of fiscal policy that
									guides these changes, experts in tax law engage in continuous education at greater rates than in many
									other fields of law. Apart from ensuring the legality of the levies on economic transactions, tax
									lawyers help clients reduce fiscal liabilities.</p>

									welfare, through adoption, to divorce. Child abuse, legitimacy, civil unions, domestic partnerships,
									and marriages are among the main aspects of family lawyersâ€™ practice.</p>

									International Law
								</h2>
								<p>International law is broad in its conception and can be broken down into private and public sectors.
									In the private sector, specialists in international law may work in finance and trade divisions of
									multinational corporations. Familiarity with business essentials, as well as corporate law or
									intellectual property law would be helpful in this field. In the public international law,
									practitioners would work on cases that involve dealings between sovereign nations. Familiarity with
									comparative law or public international law would be most helpful for effective practice in this
									field. Both private and public international law are interdisciplinary in nature and would involve an
									understanding of the differences between common law and civil law systems across borders.</p>
